# 4. Workload Definition

**Target Role: Infrastructure Operator** 

This section defines the workload definition schematics.

Workload definitions are authored by an infrastructure operator/platform builder. The purpose of workload definitions is to provide a way for an infrastructure operator/platform builder to **register** what workload types are available to application developers to define as component on a given platform. Workload definitions can define custom schemas for any type of workload. Examples include container pods, serverless functions, data stores, message queues, or any other kind of workload that an application developer needs to design a complete application. 

Usually, workload definitions are pre-installed or dynamically configured by infrastructure operators (just as traits are) so that application developers may inspect workload definition learn what workloads are available for use.

## Top-Level Attributes

Here are the attributes that provide top-level information about the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y | | A string that identifies the version of the schema the object should have. The core types uses `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2` in this version of specification |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || Must be `WorkloadDefinition` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](#metadata) | Y | | Information about the workload definition. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y | | A container for the workload definition. |

### Metadata

The metadata section describes the workload definition. See [*metadata*](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Metadata).

#### `Name`

The `name` of the workload definition indicates _the type of this workload_.

The following workload types are available and enforced by OAM specification:

|Name|Category|Schema|Exposed|Replicable|Daemonized|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|[Server](core/workloads/server.md)|Core|[ContainerizedWorkload](core/workloads/schema/containerized_workload.md)|Yes|Yes|Yes
|[Task](core/workloads/task.md)|Standard|WIP|No|Yes|No

#### `Labels`

Infrastructure operators could add below reserved `labels` to workload definition to indicates _the distinguishing characteristics of this workload type_.

|Label|Type|Explain|
|-|-|-|
|`workload.oam.dev/replicable`|boolean|Whether they are replicable. If not, no replication or scaling traits may be assigned.|
|`workload.oam.dev/daemonized`|boolean|Whether they are daemonized. For daemon types, if the workload exits, this is considered a fault, and the system must fix it. For non-daemonized types, exit is considered a success if no error is reported.|
|`workload.oam.dev/exposed`|boolean|Whether they are exposed, i.e. have a service endpoint with a stable name for network traffic. Workload types that have a service endpoint need a virtual IP address (VIP) with a DNS name to represent the component as a whole, addressable within their network scope and can be assigned traffic routing traits.|
|`workload.oam.dev/podspecable`|boolean|Whether this workload can be addressed by Kubernetes `PodSpec`. If yes, the implementation could manipulate the workload by leveraging `PodSpec` structure, instead of being agnostic of the workload's schematic. |

### Spec

The specification section contains a reference to the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `definitionRef` | [`DefinitionRef`](#DefinitionRef) | Y | | Workload schema reference. |

#### DefinitionRef

DefinitionRef defines an index to find the workload schema.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | Name of the workload schema. |

The `definitionRef.name` itself MUST contain information that can be used to uniquely identify it. An OAM runtime will use that information in a [Component](3.component.md) to refer to the workload schema instead of using the name of the workload definition.

The following conventions are RECOMMENDED:

- Use [Group/Version/Kind](2.overview_and_terminology.md#Group) to uniquely identify the schema.
- Use the `name` of the WorkloadDefinition indicates the workload type.

    For example:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
    kind: WorkloadDefinition
    metadata:
      name: MyWorkloadType
    spec:
      definitionRef:
        name: schema.example.oam.dev
    ```

## Categories of Workload

There are three categories of workloads:

__Core workloads__ are the kind of workloads that every OAM runtime MUST implement according to spec definition.

__Standard workloads__ are the kind of workloads that a OAM runtime MAY implement. However, the implementation MUST strictly adhere to the schematics defined in the spec. 

__Extended workloads__ are the kind of workloads that a OAM runtime is free to define.

### Core Workload

A core workload schema MUST be in the `core.oam.dev` group. OAM implementations MUST implement all core workloads as defined in this specification.

Here is an example of a core workload definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: MyWorkloadType
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: x.core.oam.dev
```

All core workload types are container-based, and assume that an implementation is capable of executing an OCI or Docker image as a container, and are capable of working with OCI registries.

### Standard Workload

A standard workload schema MUST be in the `standard.oam.dev` group. OAM implementations are NOT REQUIRED to implement standard workloads. However, if an implementation implements a workload that is already defined by a standard workload, it SHOULD use the standard workload definition as defined in this specification. Here is an example of a standard workload definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: MyWorkloadType
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: x.standard.oam.dev
```

### Extended Workload

Each OAM runtime may define its own workload definition beyond this specification. Any workload definition that is not part of the _core_ or _standard_ group is considered an extended workload. The name and schema of extended workloads are entirely at the discretion of the OAM implementation.

 Here is an example of an extended workload:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: MyWorkloadType
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: foo.cache.io
```
