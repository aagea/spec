# 3. Components

**Target Role: Application Developer** 

This section defines components.

The role of a component is to enable developers to declare, in infrastructure-neutral format, the characteristics of a discrete unit of execution.

Components describe functional units that may be instantiated as part of a larger distributed application. For example, each microservice in an application is described as a component. The description itself is not an instance of that microservice, but a declaration of the operational capabilities of that microservice. The [Application Configuration](7.application_configuration.md) describes how components are grouped together and how instances of those components are then configured.

## Representation

All component schematics are canonically represented as JSON and can be validated using the provided JSON Schema. Because it is more amenable for human consumption, YAML is also supported, and most of the examples are given in YAML. For the sake of validation, YAML may be converted to an equivalent JSON representation before validating it against the JSON Schema.

### Top-Level Attributes

The following attributes are common across all schemata defined in this document. They follow the [Kubernetes API convention](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields).

The attributes below provide top-level information about the component definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || A string that identifies the version of the schema the object should have. The core types uses `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2` in this version of specification. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || Must be `Component`. |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](2.overview_and_terminology.md#metadata) | Y | | Information about the component. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A specification for component attributes. |

### Spec

The spec defines the constituent parts of a component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `workload` | [`Workload`](#workload) | Y | | The specification of workload that should be passed to the runtime|
| `parameters` | [`[]Parameter`](#parameter) | N | | The component's configuration options. |

#### Workload

The specification of workload which is composed by `type` and `spec`.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Y | | The type of workload|
| `spec` | [`WorkloadSpec`](#workloadspec) | Y | | The specification template of workload. |

##### Type

In practice, the available workload types are registered by infrastructure operators/platform builders to the platform following OAM specification. We will explain this in detail in next chapter: [workload definitions](4.workload_definitions.md).

##### WorkloadSpec

This section contains the specification of the workload whose [schema](4.workload_definitions.md#DefinitionRef) is referenced by the corresponding Workload Definition. The schema can be used to validated this section. 

Note that `WorkloadSpec` is designed as **template** for the instances of workload type. For example, a Component of `Server` type could generate multiple revisions of immutable Deployments such as `server-v1` and `server-v2` in Kubernetes runtime based on the `WorkloadSpec`.

### Parameters

The Parameters section defines all of the configurable parameters for this component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The parameter's name. Must be unique per component. |
| `description` | `string` | N | | A description of the parameter. |
| `fieldPaths` | `[]string` | Y | | JSON field paths. |
| `required` | `boolean` | N |`false` | Whether a value _must_ be provided when authoring an applicationConfiguration including this component. |

Parameter `name` fields must be Unicode letter and number characters. Application Configurations will specify parameters values using this name.

Parameter `fieldPaths` specifies an array of fields within this Component's workload that will be overwritten by the value of this parameter. `fieldPaths` are specified as JSON field paths without a leading dot, for example `spec.containers[0].image`. The type of the parameter is inferred by the type of the fields to which those paths refer. Thus, all fields to which those paths refer MUST have the same type and MUST NOT be object type.

### Examples

This section illustrates a component describes `Server` workload.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: frontend
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: >
      Sample component that describes the administrative interface for our Twitter bot.
spec:
  workload:
    type: Server
    spec:
      osType: linux
      containers:
      - name: my-cool-workload
        image: example/very-cool-workload:0.1.2@sha256:verytrustworthyhash
        resources:
          cpu:
            required: 1.0
          memory:
            required: 100MB
        cmd:
        - "bash lscpu"
        ports:
        - name: http
          value: 8080
        env:
        - name: CACHE_SECRET
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            port: 8080
            path: /healthz
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            port: 8080
            path: /healthz
  parameters: 
  - name: imageName
    required: false
    fieldPaths: 
    - "spec.containers[0].image"
  - name: cacheSecret
    required: true
    fieldPaths:
    - "spec.containers[0].env[0].value"
```

> The component above assumes a `WorkloadDefinition` named `Server` exists in the system.

#### Implicit workload type

It is allowed for users to directly define `apiVersion` and `kind` instead of `workload.type` which indicates the workload type is implicit:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Component
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  workload:
    apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
    kind: ContainerizedWorkload
    spec:
      osType: linux
      containers:
      - name: my-cool-workload
        image: example/very-cool-workload:0.1.2@sha256:verytrustworthyhash
```

The component above will assume below `WorkloadDefinition` exist in the system:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: containerizedworkloads.core.oam.dev # <--- must be the same with apiGroup + Kind in the component, as well as the definitionRef.name below.
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: containerizedworkloads.core.oam.dev
```
